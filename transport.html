					<h3>How to get to Antwerp</h3>
					
					<ol>
						<li>The easiest way to get to Antwerp is to fly to Brussels Airport. <a href="https://www.brusselsairlines.com/">Brussels Airlines</a> and <a href="https://www.flysas.com/">SAS</a> fly directly from Copenhagen to Brussels. Flight time is around 1 hour and 15 minutes. From Brussels Airport you can take a train that brings you to "Antwerpen Centraal" in about 30 minutes. More information about the train can be found on <a href="http://www.belgiantrain.be">NMBS</a>.</li>
						<li>You can also fly to Eindhoven in the Netherlands with <a href="https://www.transavia.com/">Transavia</a>. With <a href="https://www.omio.com/">Omnio.com</a> and Flixbus you can book a bus from Eindhoven to Antwerpen. This means that you have to travel from Eindhoven airport to the Eindhoven city center first by bus or taxi.</li>
						<li>Ryanair flies directly from Copenhagen to <a href="https://www.brussels-charleroi-airport.com/nl">"Brussels South Charleroi Airport"</a> in the south of Belgium near Charleroi. This airport is located quite far, and has no direct bus to Antwerp. You can take a bus to Brussels or to the train station Charleroi-Sud, and from there take a train to Antwerp. The train ride takes around 2 hours. We do not recommend this option!</li>
						<li>If you want to come by car, it takes about 10 hours (without stops) to drive from Copenhagen to Antwerp. On the upside: you can take back home as much Belgian beer and chocolates as you can fit in the car! :)</li>
					</ol>
					
					<h3>How to get around</h3>
					<p>Antwerp itself is not that big, so it is easy to walk around and see a lot of the highlights.</p>
					<p>If you want to be more flexible, we would recommend you use <a href="https://www.velo-antwerpen.be/en">"Velo"</a>, Antwerp’s city bikes. There are a lot of stations around the city and you can use them for short trips up to 30 minutes. There's a convenient app that shows the nearest station to your location as well as the bike availability (also available on Google Maps). You can purchase a day- (€4) or week (€10) pass in advance and then use the provided codes when you want to use the bikes. More information can be found <a href="https://www.velo-antwerpen.be/en/how-it-works">here</a>.</p>
					
					<p>You can also use public transport, offered by <a href="https://www.delijn.be/en/?vertaling=true">"De Lijn"</a>. The easiest here is to buy a 10-ticket card in a newspaper store, or in the metro stops at "Groenplaats", "Meir" and "Opera" (you have to go down to the platform to find the vending machine). Multiple people can use the same 10-ticket card at the same time. You pay by the hour and not by travel distance. They also have an app, but unfortunately this only works with a Belgian mobile number.</p>
